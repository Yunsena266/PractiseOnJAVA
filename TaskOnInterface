/*
A method run is declared in inteface Runnable, alse there are two implementation of it: in the Car class and in the Plane class. 
There is a public static field ArrayList<Runnable> in the Solution class, alse there are 2 static methods:
addToList(Runnable), which adds an element to the list, getting as a input parameter and a method runList(), which calls the method run() for every element of list.
Your task â€” create these methods.
